            <h2> Judo Scoreboard Web App (In progress) </h2>
            <h3> BackboneJS | Underscore | jQuery </h3>
            <p> There is a lack of clean looking, easy-to-use judo scoreboard apps. <br>
                This is meant to remedy that and give a uniform experience via the web, so that even small tournaments have easy access <br>
                Stay tuned for updates. </p>
            
            <h2> Alarm Clock Web App (hiatus) </h2>
            <h3> Node | Express | Angular </h3>
            <p> An intelligent but simple alarm clock that tracks your sleeping patterns and gives insights </p>
            
            <h2> <a href=https://github.com/mnuke/sleep_reset>Sleep Reset</a> </h2>
            <h3> Python </h3>    
            <p> As a software engineer, I decided to fix my sleep schedule with code <br>
                This alarm will try and interrupt your sleep cycle right before REM sleep to destroy your sleep cycle in one night <br>
                Then the next night, it is easier to reset your sleep cycle (as long as you sleep normally). <br>
                After testing this on myself (testing is important!), it worked and I reset my sleep schedule, but I had a headache that day.            
            </p>
            
            <h2> <a href="mnuke.github.io"> Personal Website </a> </h2>
            <h3> HTML  |  CSS  |  JS (JQuery) </h3>
            <p> I designed this simple but clean website from scratch. <br>
                It is fully responsive, try resizing the window. </p>
            
            <h2> Minecraft Multi-threading Mod</h2>
            <h3> Java </h3>
            <p> As part of a U of T mentorship initiative, I worked with a professor at <a href='http://www.scinethpc.ca/'>Scinet</a> <br>
                I created a mod for Minecraft that used mutliple cores for rendering and improved performance by 20%

            <h3> Java </h3>
            <p> Programmed an object-oriented fighting game engine from scratch. <br>
                Made to support easily interchangable sprites and easily settable terrain </p>

            <h2> Data Algorithms Dev, <a href=http://www.watrhub.com/>Watrhub </a></h2>
            <h3> Python | ElasticSearch </h3>
            <p> I worked at an awesome water data startup in downtown Toronto located at <a href='http://socialinnovation.ca/'>CSI</a> <br>
                I got to work on our whole backend pipeline: <br>
                <span style="display:inline-block; width: 20px;"></span> scraping and web crawling -> unstructured classification -> text parsing to JSON <br>
                I got further in to classification and did some great work with PU learning <br>
                My work on the backend was really interesting and I integrated ElasticSearch with MongoDB to allow for full featured text-search through pdfs <br>
                Also <a href='http://www.pluckteas.com/'>the tea</a> was great.

            <h2> Data Scientist, Government </h2>
            <h3> Python </h3>
            <p> I worked on some cutting edge machine learning algorithms with fields such as pattern detection, classifications <br>
                I even invented my own algorithm for a specific area of classification

# Personal Site

This site now uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [hugo-tufte](https://github.com/loikein/hugo-tufte) theme. The about page lives at the home route and the blog lives at `/posts/`.

## Getting started

- Install Hugo if you don't have it already.
- Run `hugo server -D` to develop locally.
- Run `hugo` to build the static site into `public/`.

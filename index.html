                    <p> Hi, I'm a PhD student in artificial intelligence at <a href="https://mila.quebec/">Mila </a> associated with <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/">Université de Montréal</a> supervised by Aaron Courville. I finished my Master's there in 2019 and before that I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering student from the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>University of Waterloo</a>, during which I also spent an exchange term at <a href='http://www.lth.se'>Lund University</a> in Sweden.

                    <p> My research goal is to learn interaction with humans through language but my interests span NLP, reinforcement learning, and more</p>

                    <p>
                        I finished off the break between Master's and PhD by working with Douwe Kiela on language pretraining for interaction. I was hoping to work in NYC, which then changed to Menlo Park, and finally ended up being my living room thanks to COVID-19. I still had a good time doing the internship remotely and having awesome video calls with the team in Montreal. Work is still ongoing and I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in person once things settle down. It was also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112681480907401"> an interesting time to work at Facebook </a> and seeing the discourse from both sides.

                    <h4><a href="https://www.elementai.com/">ElementAI</a> Research Intern  </h4>
                    <p>
                        I moved one building over to work with Dzmitry Bahdanau and Harm de Vries at a vibrant Montreal startup! With the grand challenge of learning natural language database interaction, we worked on language pretraining for text-to-SQL. We had an ambitious project that ended up dealing with the fundamental expressivity of SQL and the challenge of zero-shot database adaptation. I enjoyed my time there despite the <a href="https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/"> "trying times" </a> and very fondly remember the team sitting down for lunch together.

                    <p>
                        I did consulting for NextAI's 2019 Montreal cohort giving machine learning advice to companies working on water data, supply chain management, tracking the dark web, and managing dental information! It was a great experience seeing how ML and data science can be leveraged in creative ways to make real, viable products.

                    <h4><a href="https://mila.quebec">Mila</a> Research Intern <span class="small"> Python Theano </span> </h4>
                    <p>I spent my last co-op term working in academia doing deep learning research! I worked on backpropogation through stochastic discrete neurons as applied to GANs and word embeddings coming up with novel ideas and models. I had a great time working at one of the biggest academic deep learning labs in the world and met many smart, insightful grad students.

                    Montreal as a city is also really great! I love the <a href="http://dieuduciel.com/en/">beer</a>, bakeries, and my French really improved!

                    <h4><a href="https://ai.google.com/research">Google Research</a> Software Engineering Intern <span class="small"> Python Tensorflow Blender </span> </h4>
                    <p>I got the amazing opportunity to do deep learning research at one of the top places in the world! I worked on the whole pipeline, from the proposal of an idea, figuring out a specific benchmark, creating a pipeline for generating data, and researching different architectures for the computer vision task. It was a great experience and I learned the basics of applying and researching deep learning, ending up with a pretty good result. <br>

                    I really enjoyed working with my fantastic mentor, Wei, going to reading groups, listening to tales of the early silicon valley, and meeting fantastic researchers. I delved even more into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2JBFlW--UU">coffee</a> and learned how to make a pretty decent latte (espresso machine and all), though my latte art needs some work!

                    <h4><a href="http://www.premise.com/">Premise</a> Social Capital Fellowship Intern <span class="small"> Python Java Scala Spark </span> </h4>
                    <p> I came back to San Francisco to work at a really interesting startup, changing the way we measure the economy (and a bunch of other things!) by using an app for on-the-ground contributors, paying them to collect data, and intelligently processing it to figure out what is happening across the world in real time. <br>
                    I worked as an everything engineering touching the data analysis pipeline, the android app, the server code, and even getting into some image processing. It was fun working with such a skilled, tight-knit team and I drank a lot of <a href="https://www.fourbarrelcoffee.com/">good coffee</a>)

                    <p> I spent a great four months in San Francisco working on <a href="http://www.biz.yelp.com"> biz.yelp.com </a><br>
                        I worked on full-stack web development on an agile team, getting my first real taste of Silicon Valley. Then, I dove deep into the code and worked on frontend features like the new landing page and purchasing flow, as well as backend where I internationalized check-in offers. I also discovered the best <a href="https://www.dandelionchocolate.com/">chocolate</a>.

                    <h4><a href=http://www.watrhub.com/>Watrhub</a> Software Engineering Intern <span class="small"> Python ElasticSearch </span> </h4>
                    <p> I worked at an awesome water data startup in downtown Toronto located at <a href='http://socialinnovation.ca/'>CSI</a> <br>
                        I got to work on our whole backend pipeline, from scraping and web crawling, to unstructured text classification, to text parsing. I delved further into classification and really improved our recall with positive-unlabelled learning, and did some interesting work integrating ElasticSearch with MongoDB for full featured text-search through pdfs <br>
                        Also <a href='http://www.pluckteas.com/'>the tea</a> was great.

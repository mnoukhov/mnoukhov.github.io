                    <p> Hi, I'm a Master's student in artificial intelligence at <a href="https://mila.umontreal.ca/">MILA, Université de Montréal</a> co-supervised by Aaron Courville and Yoshua Bengio. I just graduated with a Bachelor's in Software Engineering student at the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>University of Waterloo</a> in Canada, during which I also spent an exchange term at <a href='http://www.lth.se'>Lund University</a> in Sweden. </p>

                    <p> My research interests span language, reinforcement learning, and AI ethics</p>

                    <h4><a href="https://mila.umontreal.ca/">MILA, Université de Montréal</a> Research Intern <span class="small"> Python Theano </span> </h4>
                    <p>I spent my last co-op term working in academia doing deep learning research! I worked on backpropogation through stochastic discrete neurons as applied to GANs and word embeddings coming up with novel ideas and models. I had a great time working with one of the biggest deep learning labs in the world and met a lot of smart and interesting grad students.

                    Montreal as a city was also great! I loved the <a href="http://dieuduciel.com/en/">beer</a>, bakeries, and I really improved my French.
                    </p>

                    <h4><a href="http://www.research.google.com/">Google Research</a>, Software Engineering Intern <span class="small"> Python Tensorflow Blender </span> </h4>
                    <p>I got the amazing opportunity to do deep learning research at one of the top places in the world! I worked on the whole pipeline, from the proposal of an idea, figuring out a specific benchmark, creating a pipeline for generating data, and researching different architectures for the computer vision task. It was a great experience and I learned the basics of applying and researching deep learning, ending up with a pretty good result. <br>

                    I really enjoyed working with my fantastic mentor, Wei, going to reading groups, listening to tales of the early silicon valley, and meeting fantastic researchers. I delved even more into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2JBFlW--UU">coffee</a> and learned how to make a pretty decent latte (espresso machine and all!), though my latte art needs some work!
                    </p>

                    <h4><a href="http://www.premise.com/">Premise</a>, Social+Capital Fellowship Intern <span class="small"> Python Java Scala Spark </span> </h4>
                    <p> I came back to San Francisco to work at a really interesting startup, changing the way we measure the economy (and a bunch of other things!) by using an app for on-the-ground contributors, paying them to collect data, and intelligently processing it to figure out what is happening across the world in real time. <br>
                    I worked as an everything engineering touching the data analysis pipeline, the android app, the server code, and even getting into some image processing. It was a lot of fun working with such a skilled, tight-knit team and I drank a lot of <a href="https://www.fourbarrelcoffee.com/">lot</a>)
                    </p>

                    <h4><a href=http://www.yelp.com/>Yelp</a>, Software Engineering Intern <span class="small"> Python Javascript </span> </h4>
                    <p> I spent a great four months in San Francisco working on <a href="http://www.biz.yelp.com"> biz.yelp.com </a><br>
                        I worked on full-stack web development on an agile team, getting my first real taste of Silicon Valley. Then, I dove deep into the code and worked on frontend features like the new landing page and purchasing flow, as well as backend where I internationalized check-in offers. I also discovered the best <a href="https://www.dandelionchocolate.com/">chocolate</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4><a href=http://www.watrhub.com/>Watrhub</a>, Data Algorithms Dev <span class="small"> Python ElasticSearch </span> </h4>
                    <p> I worked at an awesome water data startup in downtown Toronto located at <a href='http://socialinnovation.ca/'>CSI</a> <br>
                        I got to work on our whole backend pipeline, from scraping and web crawling, to unstructured text classification, to text parsing. I delved further into classification and really improved our recall with positive-unlabelled learning, and did some interesting work integrating ElasticSearch with MongoDB for full featured text-search through pdfs <br>
                        Also <a href='http://www.pluckteas.com/'>the tea</a> was great.

                    <h4> Canadian Government, Data Scientist<span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
                    <p> I worked on some statistical machine learning algorithms with fields such as pattern detection, classifications and I even implemented a novel algorithm for classification!
                    </p>

					<h3 id="about"> About</h3>
					<p> Hi, I'm a 3rd year Software Engineering student at the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>University of Waterloo</a> in Canada, but currently I'm on exchange in Sweden at <a href='http://www.lth.se'>Lund University</a>. I just finished interning at <a href="http://www.premise.com">Premise</a> in San Francisco, where I learned a lot about data engineering, machine learning, Android, and coffee! </p>
					
					<h3 id="projects"> Projects </h3>
						
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/htn-prototypr/prototypr'>Prototypr</a> <span class="small">Python OpenCV Tesseract</span> </h4>
					<p> I worked on the image processing for this android app that allows you to take a picture of an app screen drawing (on paper) that gets quickly turned into a real app using React.js, made as part of Hack the North 2015. </p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/mnuke/Card'>Card</a>  <span class="small">Android</span> </h4>
					<p> An android app for creating and sharing electronic business cards using NFC, made as a part of Calhacks 2014 </p>

					<h4> Meta-Reviewer  <span class="small">Python</span> </h4>
					<p> A machine learning classifier that reviews a Yelp user's reviews. Determines the overall quality of a user's Yelp reviews against training data of 1 million reviews, made as part of Yelp Fall 2014 Hackathon. </p>

					<h4> <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/my-program/6562451917564904'> Coin Flipping Distribution Simulator </a><span class="small"> Javascript </span> </h4>
					<p> A simple distribution simulation to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem. Flip coins like no tomorrow!</p>

					<h4> Minecraft Multi-threading Mod</a>  <span class="small">Java</span></h4>
					<p> As part of a U of T mentorship initiative, I worked with a professor at <a href='http://www.scinethpc.ca/'>Scinet</a> to create a mod for Minecraft that used mutliple cores for rendering and improved performance by 20% 
					</p>
					
					<h4> <a href="https://github.com/mnuke/JavaFighter"> 3D Fighting Game </a></a><span class="small"> Java </span> </h4>
					<p> An object-oriented fighting game engine from scratch, made to support easily interchangable sprites and custom terrain </p>


					<h3 id="experience"> Experience </h3>
					<h4><a href="http://www.premise.com/">Premise</a>, Social+Capital Fellowship Intern <span class="small"> Python Java Scala Spark </span> </h4>
					<p> Came back to San Francisco to work at this really interesting startup that is changing the way we measure the economy (and a bunch of other things!) by using an app for on-the-ground contributors, paying them to collect data and intelligently processing it to figure out what is happening across the world in real time. <br>
					I worked as an everything engineering touching the data analysis pipeline, the android app, the server code, and even getting into some image processing. It was great working with such a skilled small team and I drank boatloads of coffee.
					</p>

					<h4><a href=http://www.yelp.com/>Yelp</a>, Software Engineering Intern <span class="small"> Python Javascript </span> </h4>
					<p> I spent a great four months in San Francisco working on <a href="http://www.biz.yelp.com"> biz.yelp.com </a><br>
						I worked on full-stack web development using agile methodology (sounds way cooler than it is). Dove deep into the code and worked on frontend features like the new landing page and purchasing flow as well as backend where I internationalized check-in offers.  
					</p>

					<h4><a href=http://www.watrhub.com/>Watrhub </a>, Data Algorithms Dev <span class="small"> Python ElasticSearch </span> </h4>
					<p> I worked at an awesome water data startup in downtown Toronto located at <a href='http://socialinnovation.ca/'>CSI</a> <br>
						I got to work on our whole backend pipeline, from scraping and web crawling, to unstructured text classification, to text parsing. I delved further into classification and did some great work with PU learning as well as some interesting work integrating ElasticSearch with MongoDB for full featured text-search through pdfs <br>
						Also <a href='http://www.pluckteas.com/'>the tea</a> was great. 
					</p>
						
					<h4> Canadian Government, Data Scientist<span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> I worked on some cutting edge machine learning algorithms with fields such as pattern detection, classifications and I even invented my own algorithm for a specific area of classification!
					</p>
					
					<h4> <a href="http://www.cysjournal.ca"> Canadian Young Scientist Journal</a>, Web Developer <span class="small"> Drupal </span> </h4>
					<p> I acted as webmaster for this non-profit peer-reviewed scientific journal until it moved to NRC Research Press, updating the website with news and UI tweaks here and there
